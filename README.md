# A City Ful of Events
A physicalization of the City of Victoria, BC, Canada's events at its 6 most popular venues from May ~ Sept 2022.
I did for class with 2 other classmates: Mohammad Shakirul Islam and Nazanin Shamshiri. The encoded map of Victoria was 3D printed and we used as Mega2560 board, so we had lots of pins to add lights, screens, buttons and the knob.

This is mostly so you can see the arduino code. The STL of the city map you can attach this to is:

A stand is available here and you can scale up the z-axis to your desired height:
